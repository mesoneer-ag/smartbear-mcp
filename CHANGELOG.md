# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- [QTM4J] `create_test_case` and `create_test_cycle` no longer discard the caller's `folderId`: a numeric folder ID is now sent to the API as given, so test cases and cycles can be created in a specific folder. Both tools still fall back to the `MCP Generated` folder when `folderId` is omitted, and `create_test_cycle` accepts `folderId` for the first time.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- [Swagger] `standardize_api` tool: returns a `url` only when the server confirms the fix was saved (`savedVersion`).
- [Swagger] `resolve_organization_portal` tool: the generated subdomain now follows the Portal UI convention - slugified organization name plus a random 3-character suffix (e.g. `acmecorp-k7p`), appended even without a collision.
- [Swagger] `create_portal` tool: the `subdomain` parameter description now recommends the same convention, while the client still picks the value.
- [PactFlow] Added `pageNumber`/`pageSize` pagination (default page size 5) across list and Bi-Directional Contract Testing tools, with tool-layer caching for PactFlow endpoints that don't paginate natively. [#623](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/623)

### Fixed

- [Swagger] Fixed Swagger Functional Testing Integration documentation to include all available tools and their descriptions, as well as adjusts wrong tool sections.
- [Swagger] Corrected `openWorldHint` tool annotations: portal, product, table-of-contents, document, and registry write tools are now declared as closed-world (`openWorldHint: false`); only the AI-backed `create_api_from_prompt` and `standardize_api` tools remain open-world.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- [Swagger] Added `create_test` Functional Testing tool that creates a new API test with set of steps.
- [Zephyr] Added `Get Test Plans` tool that retrieves Test Plans using the cursor-paginated NextGen endpoint.

### Changed

- [Zephyr] Refactor to keep REST API schemas unmodified and ensure correct payload for update operations [#609](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/609)

### Security

- Fixed session isolation vulnerability (Base Path Injection / SSRF): `ClientRegistry.configure()` now calls `cloneClient()` to produce a fresh client instance per session, preventing per-session state (base-path URLs, auth tokens) stored on one session's client from leaking into concurrent sessions.
- Fixed credential leakage vulnerability: because each session receives its own client clone, an unauthenticated session no longer inherits a previously authenticated session's `SwaggerClient` API instance or API key. An unauthenticated session has no Swagger tools available.
- [Swagger] Changed `portal_base_path`, `registry_base_path`, `ui_base_path`, and `functional_testing_base_path` config fields from `z.string()` to `z.url()`, enabling allowlist enforcement via `MCP_ALLOWED_ENDPOINTS` and rejecting non-URL values at parse time.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- [QTM4J] Added test execution tools to start executions, update test case and step executions. [#604](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/604)
- [QTM4J] Added API request tracking. [#604](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/604)

### Fixed

- [QTM4J] Fixed `search_test_cases` response validation errors when test case fields are missing. [#604](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/604)

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- [BearQ] Remove draft-test refinement tools and add `bearq_delete_test_cases` [#593](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/593)

### Fixed

- [Swagger] Adjusted some of the Swagger Functional Testing tools responses to return `url` of test or test Suite execution.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- [Swagger] Added output schemas to Swagger Portal and Registry tools, enabling structured, validated responses for all portal, product, section, document, table-of-contents, and registry operations.
- [Swagger] Introduced tool constants (`READ_ONLY`, `WRITE`, `WRITE_DESTRUCTIVE`) to annotate each Swagger tool with semantic flags (`readOnly`, `openWorld`, `destructive`) for better client-side tool classification.
- [Swagger] Added `get_test_history` Functional Testing tool that retrieves the execution history for a given test, returning past runs with pass/fail status, run time, creation timestamp, and per-step failure details for failed runs.

### Changed

- [Pactflow] Replaced the static `USER_AGENT` constant with a dynamic `getUserAgent()` call in `PactflowClient.requestHeaders`, ensuring the outbound `User-Agent` header always includes the identified MCP client name and version. Removed the `SOURCE_APPLICATION` header.

- [Reflect] Add create_test and create_segment tools to enable agents to port tests from open source frameworks (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright) and other SmartBear products (TestComplete, BearQ) to Reflect.

- [Swagger] Refactor error handling for Functional Testing tools

### Fixed

- [Pactflow] Corrected MCP tool hint annotations for all 102 PactFlow tools. Previously, `readOnlyHint` defaulted to `true` for every tool because no tool explicitly set `readOnly`, causing write/delete operations to be misreported as read-only. All tools now declare all four hints explicitly: `readOnly` (58 read-only, 44 write), `destructive` (true for DELETE ops, `resetAdminRoles`, and `regenerateToken`), `idempotent` (false for creates, records, patch, execute, and invite operations), and `openWorld` (true for `executeWebhook`, `executeWebhooks`, and `inviteUsers` which trigger external HTTP requests or send emails).
- [Swagger] Added a conditional required-field rule to the `create_table_of_contents` tool's `content` schema so `url` is structurally required only when `content.type` is `apiUrl`, instead of relying solely on prose descriptions. Addresses an "Unclear Arguments" flag from ChatGPT app review while keeping `content` as a flat object for manual tool testing.
- [Swagger] Fixed a client-side "data should NOT have additional properties" validation error shown for tools like `get_portal_product` that return extra fields (e.g. `role`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) not modeled in their output schema. The MCP server now advertises the intended `additionalProperties: true` for these loosely-typed output schemas instead of losing that setting during tool registration. [#553](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/553)

### Security

- [Swagger] Prevented organization admin email addresses from being exposed through the `list_organizations` tool. Introduced `OrganizationListItem` type that omits the `email` field, filtered organization list data at the MCP boundary, and updated the output schema and documentation accordingly.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- [Common] Co-located all unit test files with their source files (`path/to/file.ts` → `path/to/file.test.ts`), removing the top-level `src/tests/unit/` directory. Updated `vitest.config.ts` include/exclude globs and coverage excludes accordingly.

### Security

- [Common] Upgraded `libcrypto3` and `libssl3` Alpine packages from `3.5.6-r0` to `3.5.7-r0` in the Docker release image to address CVE-2026-34182 (CRITICAL), CVE-2026-45447 (HIGH), CVE-2026-7383 (HIGH), and CVE-2026-45445 (HIGH) [#572](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/572)

- [Common] Capture MCP client identity (`clientInfo.name`/`version`) from the `initialize` handshake and store it in the session context. The normalized client name and version are forwarded on the outbound User-Agent for all downstream API requests and attached to BugSnag event metadata, enabling usage attribution by originating MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Copilot Studio, etc.) without client-side changes [#532](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/532)
- [Zephyr] Update Zephyr Schemas - Change ComponentID min in Create Test Case to 1 [#574](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/574)

### Fixed

- [Pactflow] Fixed CDCT failures: removed `deployable` from the `can-i-deploy` summary matcher (the API legitimately returns `null` when no verification result exists between integrated services, not a boolean) and removed the `PUT /webhooks/{id}` consumer interaction which fails provider-side UUID validation due to the 16-character minimum enforced by the webhook contract. [#578](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/578)

- [Pactflow] Fixed consumer pact tests for AI generate and review endpoints: updated both interactions to expect `202 Accepted` with a `StatusResponse` body (`status`, `session_id`, `submitted_at`, `status_url`, `result_url`) instead of a synchronous `200` response, matching the async job pattern the `pactflow-ai-api` provider now uses.

### Added

- [Pactflow] Added Pact V4 consumer contract tests covering PactflowClient HTTP interactions, with a dedicated CI pipeline that publishes pacts to PactFlow and gates on CDCT verification. Tests cover can-i-deploy, matrix, pacticipants, environments, deployments, webhooks, secrets, labels, admin users/teams/roles, system accounts, API tokens, BDCT endpoints, and more. Fixed `setTeamUsers` request body key (`uuids` → `users`) to match the provider API contract.

- [Swagger] Extended Swagger Functional Testing integration with `run_suite`, and `get_suite_status` tools for executing available suites and querying their execution.

- [Swagger] Added `list_suite_executions` tool for reviewing the execution history and timings of a test suite in your Swagger Functional Testing workspace. Requires `SWAGGER_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_API_TOKEN` env var.

- [Swagger] Added `cancel_suite_execution` tool for stopping an ongoing test suite execution in your Swagger Functional Testing workspace. Requires `suiteId` and `executionId`. Requires `SWAGGER_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_API_TOKEN` env var.

- [BearQ] Add environment targeting to the run tools and a `bearq_list_environments` tool [#565](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/565)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- [Pactflow]: Send the MCP client's name and version to Pactflow via a `SOURCE_APPLICATION` header on requests, captured from the client info supplied in the MCP `initialize` request. [#556](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/556)

### Added

- [Swagger] `create_documentation_page` now accepts an optional `pageSlug` parameter. When provided, it is used as the page URL slug; otherwise the slug is generated from the page title.
- [Swagger] Added `list_suites` tool for discovering test suites in your Swagger Functional Testing workspace. Requires `SWAGGER_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_API_TOKEN` env var.

### Fixed

- [Zephyr] Fixed `get_test_case_steps` returning a schema validation error [#543](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/543)
- [Zephyr] Update Zephyr schemas [#562](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/562)

## [0.27.2] - 2026-07-01

- [CI] Extracted publishing of the standalone `com.smartbear/swagger-mcp` registry entry (`server.swagger.json`) into a dedicated, manually triggered `publish-swagger-mcp.yaml` workflow (`workflow_dispatch`), removing those steps from the main `publish.yaml`. [#554](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/554)

## [0.27.1] - 2026-06-29

- [Swagger]: Removed the https://swagger.mcp.smartbear.com/mcp streamable-http remote from the remotes array in server.json.[#550](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/550)

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-29

- [Qmetry]: add Test Run UDF workflow support and customer fixes [#538](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/538)

### Added

- [Swagger] Extended `publish_portal_product` to build published URLs dynamically from `SWAGGER_PORTAL_BASE_PATH`, support preview and section/table-of-contents paths, and return the resolved `liveUrl` or `previewUrl` plus product, portal, and table-of-contents metadata in the publish response. If `portal.customDomain` is present, the client now uses it as the full host without appending the portal UI suffix. For url generation product and portal details ar required and section and toc details are optional.
  [#525](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/525)

- [Swagger] Add `create_documentation_page` tool to create a documentation page in a portal product in a single call. Supports `markdown` and `html` content types with `internal` or `external` source. Returns page details and a `draftUrl` to edit the page in the portal admin.

- [Swagger] Extended Swagger Functional Testing integration with `run_test`, and `get_test_status` tools for executing available API tests and querying their execution.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- [Swagger] Register Portal/Studio tools when authenticated via OAuth. Previously only an explicit API key (`SWAGGER_API_KEY` / `Swagger-Api-Key` header) enabled the tools, so OAuth-only sessions listed no Swagger tools. [#537](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/537)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- [Swagger] Add `scan_api_standardization_from_registry` tool to fetch and scan an API definition from the registry, returning results with total issue count and counts by severity [#510](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/510)

- [Reflect] Added `get_test_detail` tool for retrieving full test details including name, description, and all recorded steps [#524](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/524)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- [Common] Reverted [#487](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/487) due to request scoping issue. [#512](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/512)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- [Common] Add `MCP_TOOLSETS` environment variable to allow tools to be grouped into sets for better organization and client control [#474](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/474)
- [Common] Split authorization and configuration options to better suit OAuth flow [#487](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/487)
- [QTM4J] Added support for linking and unlinking requirements, test cases, and test cycles through new tools. [#505](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/505)
- [QTM4J] Added tools for retrieving linked requirements and test cases across requirements, test cases, and test cycles. [#505](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/505)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- [QTM4J] Added test automation capabilities, including automation result uploads and import history retrieval. [#501](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/501)

### Fixed

- [PactFlow] Remove `.email()` Zod validator from PactFlow admin user tool schemas — the generated JSON Schema pattern used regex lookahead which is rejected by strict JSON Schema validators (e.g. OpenAI gpt-5.5) [#491](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/issues/491)
- [BearQ] Fix BearQ integration page not appearing in live docs [#496](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/496)
- [Swagger] Add constraint in the create_portal tool schema description, that allows only one Portal per organization.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- [BearQ] Add BearQ integration with 11 tools for AI-powered QA: run regression tests, run/refine test cases and functional areas, expand the application model, chat with the QA lead agent, and manage async tasks (`get_task`, `get_task_status`, `wait_for_task`, `stop_task`) [#485](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/485)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- [Common] Only advertise prompts and resources capabilities when provided by clients [#480](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/480)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- [QTM4J] Add QTM4J (QMetry Test Management for Jira) capabilities to MCP [#476](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/476)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- [Common] Add graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT in HTTP mode: drains active sessions (closes Streamable HTTP and SSE transports, runs per-client `cleanupSession` hooks including Reflect WebSocket teardown), with a configurable deadline via `MCP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 25s) [#455](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/455)
- [Common] Split health/readiness probes: `GET /health` is now liveness-only and always returns 200 when the process is responsive; `GET /ready` is the readiness probe and returns 503 during drain so load balancers stop routing new sessions to draining pods. Both probes set `Cache-Control: no-store`. [#455](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/455)
- [Common] Add product prefix to registered resources and prompts [#458](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/458)

### Fixed

- [Common] Streamable HTTP requests carrying an `MCP-Session-Id` the server doesn't recognize now return `404` (with a JSON-RPC error envelope, code `-32001`) instead of `400`. This aligns with the MCP Streamable HTTP spec's Session Management rules, which require a 404 for requests against a terminated session and oblige clients to respond by sending a fresh `InitializeRequest`. In multi-pod deployments this lets clients transparently re-initialize after a pod restart or routing reshuffle drops the in-memory session, instead of treating it as a permanent protocol error. [#449](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/449)
- [Common] Configuration options can now be passed in via query string parameters for HTTP transport [#453](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/453)
- [Swagger] Remove unused `role` parameter from the `create_portal_product` tool. [#469](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/469)
- [Swagger] Portal API error responses now surface the human-readable reason instead of showing `HTTP 400:` with no message. The client reads the `application/problem+json` error body and extracts the `detail` field (RFC 7807); falls back to `message` if absent. [#468](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/468)
- [Pactflow][Collaborator] Reduced tool names under the apparent 64 character limit for Claude connectors [#470](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/470)
- [Pactflow] Fix bug that prevents MCP server from starting with no configuration (for tool exploration) [#445](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp/pull/445)
